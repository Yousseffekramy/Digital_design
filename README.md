# HDLBits-Verilog-Solutions

Welcome to the `HDLBits-Verilog-Solutions` repository!

This repository contains my solutions to the practice problems available on the HDLBits platform, which cover a wide range of topics in `Digital Logic Design` using `Verilog HDL`.

Each solution file is named after the corresponding problem number and contains comments explaining the design approach and any assumptions made. You can use these solutions as a reference to compare your own solutions or to learn new techniques.
